# Export Chain Fix - Phase 2 Follow-up

**Date:** 2026-02-28  
**Issue:** `SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/app/data/mock.ts' does not provide an export named 'DESTINATIONS'`  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem

After reorganizing the destinations data structure in Phase 2, the export chain was broken due to ambiguous module resolution. When using `export * from "./destinations"`, the build system couldn't determine whether to import from:
- `/src/app/data/destinations.ts` (the legacy file)
- `/src/app/data/destinations/index.ts` (the new aggregator)

This caused a circular reference issue where `destinations.ts` was trying to re-export from itself.

---

## Solution

Made the exports explicit using named exports instead of wildcard re-exports.

### Files Fixed

#### 1. `/src/app/data/destinations.ts` ✅

**Before:**
```typescript
// Re-export everything from new structure
export * from "./destinations";  // ❌ Ambiguous - circular reference
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Re-export everything from new structure (explicit named exports)
export {
  DESTINATIONS,
  CONTINENTS,
  COUNTRIES,
  REGIONS,
  AFRICA_DESTINATIONS,
  ASIA_DESTINATIONS,
  EUROPE_DESTINATIONS,
  NORTH_AMERICA_DESTINATIONS,
  SOUTH_AMERICA_DESTINATIONS,
  OCEANIA_DESTINATIONS,
} from "./destinations/index";  // ✅ Explicit path to folder/index.ts
```

#### 2. `/src/app/data/mock.ts` ✅

**Before:**
```typescript
export * from "./destinations";  // ❌ Relied on wildcard re-export
export * from "./common";        // ❌ Relied on wildcard re-export
```

**After:**
```typescript
export { DESTINATIONS, CONTINENTS, COUNTRIES, REGIONS } from "./destinations";  // ✅ Explicit
export { TRAVEL_STYLES, BRANDS, FACILITIES, PAGES } from "./common";           // ✅ Explicit
export { getContinent, getTravelStyle, getBrand, getFacility, getPage } from "./common";  // ✅ Helper functions
```

## Export Chain (Now Working)

```
Page Component (e.g., DestinationsArchiveEnhanced.tsx)
  ↓ imports from
mock.ts
  ↓ imports from
destinations.ts (legacy re-export)
  ↓ imports from
destinations/index.ts (main aggregator)
  ↓ imports from
destinations/africa/index.ts (continent aggregator)
  ↓ imports from
destinations/africa/south-africa.ts (country data)
destinations/africa/south-africa-regions.ts (region data)
```

**Each level now uses explicit named exports, eliminating ambiguity.**

---

## What's Now Exported

### From `mock.ts`:

**Destinations:**
- `DESTINATIONS` - All destinations (countries + regions)
- `CONTINENTS` - Continent taxonomy (6 continents)
- `COUNTRIES` - Only countries
- `REGIONS` - Only regions/cities/parks

**Common:**
- `TRAVEL_STYLES` - Travel style taxonomy
- `BRANDS` - Brand taxonomy
- `FACILITIES` - Facility taxonomy
- `PAGES` - Core pages
- `getContinent()` - Helper function
- `getTravelStyle()` - Helper function
- `getBrand()` - Helper function
- `getFacility()` - Helper function
- `getPage()` - Helper function

**Tours, Accommodation, Blog, etc.:**
- All other existing exports remain unchanged

---

## Testing

✅ **Verified Working:**
- Page loads without errors
- DESTINATIONS export is available
- CONTINENTS export is available
- All helper functions accessible
- No circular reference errors
- No module resolution errors

**Routes Tested:**
- `/destinations` - Archive page loads ✅
- `/destinations/south-africa` - Country page loads ✅
- `/destinations/cape-town` - City page loads ✅

---

## Key Takeaway

**When creating barrel exports that reference folders:**

❌ **Don't do this (ambiguous):**
```typescript
export * from "./destinations";  // Could be destinations.ts OR destinations/index.ts
```

✅ **Do this (explicit):**
```typescript
export { DESTINATIONS, CONTINENTS } from "./destinations/index";
```

Or even better:
```typescript
export { DESTINATIONS, CONTINENTS } from "./destinations/index.ts";
```

This makes the intent clear and avoids module resolution conflicts.

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Build:** ✅ PASSING  
**Runtime:** ✅ NO ERRORS  
**Backward Compatibility:** ✅ MAINTAINED
